<h1 align="center">E-BIZ</h1>

<p align="center"><big>installation procedure</big></p>

<p align="left">E-Biz is an Online Shopping WinCGI script. This section is not about
explaining what CGI is and how it works .<br>
To Install and execute the programs correctly please read the following instructions:</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><big>Installation<br>
</big></font>Ebiz.Zip has been compressed by preserving path. While extracting we
recommend to preserve the path. This will ensure that you have the right files in the
right folder. You can understand the procedure by only preserving path while extracting.
After extraction you should see 3 folders ( <strong>cgiebiz, source, ebiz</strong>) and 2
files <strong>ebiz.htm</strong> and <strong>install.htm</strong>l. <em>install.html is
what you are reading now!</em><br>
After extracting to a temporary directory follow these:</p>

<p align="left">1. Copy <strong><font color="#FF0000">ebiz.htm</font></strong> to your
server path, the folder which your server as the initial path/ root path. <br>
<br>
2. Copy the <font color="#FF0000"><strong>folder ebiz</strong></font> to the server path.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So by now you should
have in your server folder (or Server path)&nbsp; <em><font color="#008000">an HTML page
called ebiz.htm and a folder named ebiz conatining 10 files.</font></em> </p>

<p align="left">3. Copy the <font color="#FF0000"><strong>folder</strong></font> <font
color="#FF0000"><strong>cgiebiz</strong></font> to a folder<font color="#FF0000"><strong>
serverpath/cgi-win/</strong></font></p>

<p align="left">The path of the WInCGI scripts in all the HTML pages have been written as
&quot;/cgi-win/&quot;. Most servers have different path for CGI-BIN and CGI-WIN. In case,
your server has the same path for both scripts then I am sorry you will have to create a
new path called cgi-win in your server directory and make the&nbsp; server recognize it as
the win-cgi path or a CGI executable folder.<br>
<br>
All the CGI calls in the example are made to &quot;<font color="#FF0000"><strong>/cgi-win/cgiebiz/ebiz.exe</strong></font>&quot;,
so you cannot place the programs in any folder you like!<br>
